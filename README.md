# SOCKIT Binaries 

Find the .rbf bitstream binaries under their category (arcades, computer, consoles, others).

Each binary includes in the filename the date when was made. 

### MiSTer cores

**_ * _MiSTer** folders are exclusive for the MiSTer platform.

Copy the rbf binaries into the _Arcade, _Computer, _Other, _Console folders of the MiSTer SD card.

JOTEGO cores for SoCkit MiSTer platform can be found at https://github.com/sockitfpga/jtbin

More MiSTer compatible and up to date cores can be found at [Noemi's GitHub](https://github.com/noemi-abril) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/noemiabril)

### Direct cores

Arcades, Computers, Consoles and Others include only direct cores, and are not intended to be used with the MiSTer platform as they expect direct ps2 keyboard input for example.

**To flash the bitstreams to the FPGA** with USB cable follow the instructions described in https://github.com/DECAfpga/DECA_board/tree/main/Tutorials/Uploading-Cores.
